That means the 112 cores on a 4060 can deliver the same raw Tensor throughput as the 544 cores on a 2080 Ti, but with a fraction of the power.\n2. **Die efficiency** – The 4060’s 8nm process (Ada Lovelace) is roughly 30–40 % more power‑efficient than the 12nm process used in the 2080 Ti.\n3. **Software support** – Newer CUDA and cuDNN versions can take advantage of FP8 and Tensor‑Float‑4, cutting both compute and memory bandwidth requirements for large transformer models.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n| Verdict | 2080 Ti | RTX 4060 |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| **Best for heavy‑weight inference on large models (≥ 8 GB)** | Slight advantage because of 11 GB VRAM | 8 GB is a hard ceiling; 4060 shines on smaller models or when you can fit the model in 8 GB |\n| **Best for small‑to‑medium inference (≤ 6 GB)** | Works well but draws more power | Excellent – 2× faster per watt, newer precision options |\n| **Best for training (FP16/FP32)** | Good raw throughput; memory ceiling is the main bottleneck | Slightly higher FP32 throughput, but still memory‑limited; still better efficiency |\n| **Overall power‑efficient AI card** | 260 W | 125 W |\n| **Future‑proofing (new AI formats)** | Limited to FP16/INT8/BF16 | Supports FP8, TF‑4, and upcoming mixed‑precision tricks |\n\nSo, if you’re looking for the *most power‑efficient GPU that can still keep up with modern inference workloads*, the RTX 4060 is the clear winner.  \nIf you need the extra 3 GB of VRAM or you’re already running on a 2080 Ti‑based rig, the 2080 Ti remains a solid all‑rounder, but it will cost you roughly twice the power for a similar AI throughput.",

The memory bandwidth is identical, so FP16 inference speed is limited by CUDA core throughput, not memory. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Memory capacity & bandwidth\n\n| GPU | VRAM | Bandwidth | Implication for AI |\n|-----|------|-----------|--------------------|\n| RTX 2080 Ti | 11 GB | 616 GB/s | Can hold very large transformer models (≈ 10 GB) and offers plenty of headroom for double‑precision or large FP16 tensors. |\n| RTX 4060 | 8 GB | 448 GB/s | Adequate for most 6–8 GB models; new FP8/TF‑4 formats can keep larger models in‑memory. |\n| GTX 1070 Super | 8 GB | 448 GB/s | Same size as the 4060, but without tensor acceleration. The memory bandwidth is identical, so FP16 inference speed is limited by CUDA core throughput, not memory. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Power consumption & cooling\n\n| GPU | TDP | Typical thermal headroom | Estimated 16‑hour “training day” energy |\n|-----|-----|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| RTX 2080 Ti | 260 W | Needs a 650 W PSU + good case airflow | ~4.16 kWh |\n| RTX 4060 | 125 W | Can run on a 650 W PSU with minimal airflow | ~2.00 kWh |\n| GTX 1070 Super | 150 W | Works fine on a 500 W PSU | ~2.40 kWh |\n\n> **Energy cost**: If your electricity bill is $0.12/kWh, a single 16‑hour run on the 2080 Ti costs about **$0.50**, whereas the 4060 would cost **$0.24** and the 1070 Super about **$0.29**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. “What if I’m training a large model?”\n\n| Scenario | 2080 Ti | RTX 4060 | GTX 1070 Super |\n|----------|---------|----------|----------------|\n| **FP16 training 8 GB model** | 11 GB VRAM → just enough, but you’ll need gradient accumulation or model sharding | 8 GB VRAM → fits, but no room for extra buffers; use FP8 or TF‑4 if supported | 8 GB VRAM → fits, but slower FP16 throughput; still feasible with gradient accumulation |\n| **FP32 training 8 GB model** | 11 GB VRAM → fits comfortably | 8 GB VRAM → fits but less room for optimizer states | 8 GB VRAM → fits; slower FP32 throughput |\n| **Inference on 10 GB model** | Works (11 GB VRAM) | Won’t fit (only 8 GB) | Won’t fit |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom‑line “AI‑friendly” verdict\n\n| GPU | Best for | Drawback |\n|-----|----------|----------|\n| **RTX 2080 Ti** | Heavy‑weight inference (≥ 8 GB) and mixed‑precision training on a single GPU | High power draw, larger size |\n| **RTX 4060** | Mid‑range inference (≤ 6 GB), small‑to‑medium training, and all new FP8/TF‑4 formats | Memory capacity limits very large models |\n| **GTX 1070 Super** | Legacy workloads, FP16 inference on small models, or when you have no other option | No Tensor/RT cores → significantly slower on mixed‑precision AI tasks |\n\n> **Fun fact:** Even though the 1070 Super is *older* and has *fewer* cores, its FP16 throughput (≈ 10.6 TF) is still comparable to the 2080 Ti’s FP16 *half‑precision* speed (22.6 TF) because of its higher boost clock and fewer pipeline stalls, but it simply can’t match the newer tensor‑core acceleration.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n*If you’re looking for **power‑efficient AI work** today, the RTX 4060 wins hands‑down: it’s twice as fast on tensor ops, uses roughly half the power, and still offers decent FP16 throughput.  \nThe RTX 2080 Ti is a great jump‑starter for larger models that need that extra 3 GB of VRAM, but it’s a heavier, more expensive card.  \nThe GTX 1070 Super is a nostalgic “good‑enough” card for legacy workloads, but it lacks the Tensor‑core acceleration that modern AI libraries rely on.*"
